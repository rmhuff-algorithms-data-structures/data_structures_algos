ARRAYS
------
Lookup - O(i)
Insert - O(n)
Delete - O(n)

Arrays are stored consecutively in memory. This is what makes lookup so quick. If the first
element on of array of integers is stored at 100. Given that integers are 4 bytes in Java, the
calculation to find an element is simple.

Arrays are static. This makes altering them a potentially costly operation.
